// THIS FILE HAS BEEN DISABLED
// The tests in this file reference methods that don't exist in the current ResourceManager implementation.
// These tests were written for an older version of ResourceManager.
// 
// To re-enable these tests, the ResourceManager would need to implement:
// - SetResourceCount(string resourceId, long count)
// - GetResourceTypeCount()
// - GetAllResourceCounts()
// - ClearAllResources()
// - LoadResourceCounts(Dictionary<string, long> counts)
//
// Or the tests need to be rewritten to match the current ResourceManager API.
//
// Original file renamed to: ResourceManagerTests.cs.DISABLED
