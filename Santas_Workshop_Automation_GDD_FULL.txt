Version: 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------

1. CORE PLAYER GOALS & PROGRESSION
----------------------------------
Objective: Build and optimize Santa’s automated workshop to produce high-quality toys before each Christmas. Quantity, complexity, and efficiency contribute to the Christmas Spirit Score that defines seasonal success.

Seasonal Cycle:
- In‑game year: January → December. Time can be paused or run at 1×/2×/3×.
- Christmas Rush (Nov–Dec): increased demand and stress testing of systems; unique music layer and UI flair.
- Christmas Eve (23:59): production halts; summary report with toy counts, grades, delivery rate, energy efficiency, and Spirit Score.
- Carryover: Factory layout, research, unlocks, and cosmetics persist into the next year.

Mission-Based Hybrid Structure:
- Campaign missions onboard the player while unlocking systems (tutorial → mastery).
- Post-campaign Sandbox mode continues infinitely with optional challenges and contracts.
- No hard fail; underperformance yields coaching dialogue and softer goals next year.

Example Mission Arc:
1. The First Conveyor – build a basic line and deliver first gifts.
2. Power Problems – introduce generators, grid, and brownout management.
3. A Wrapping Worry – packaging automation and quality grading.
4. Santa’s Quality Standards – S/A/B/C grades, rework loops, inspection.
5. The Great Christmas Rush – achieve quota under time pressure.
6. New Year, New Toys – unlock Tier II chains and research branches.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROGRESSION & RESEARCH
------------------------------------------------------------
Design Principle: Branching, open‑ended tech allowing specialization and replayability.

Branches:
- Automation & Machinery: Conveyors, inserters, splitters, smart routing, assembler tiers.
- Energy & Power: Fuel → electric → renewable → aurora magic; storage and grid optimization.
- Materials & Refinement: Smelting, plastics, textiles, glass; composite materials later.
- Toy Innovation: Unlocks toy tiers and specialty machines/blueprints.
- Logistics & Delivery: Warehouses, drones, teleport belts, dispatch optimizations.
- Elf Management & Research: RP rate, queues, specialists, lab upgrades.
- Magical Integration: Overclocking, enchanted machines, spirit conduits.
- Festive & Aesthetic: Cosmetics, cheer auras, minor efficiency buffs.

Synergy Nodes:
- Aurora Generator (Energy + Magic): Clean late‑game power unlocked by cross‑branch progress.
- Enchanted Assemblers (Automation + Magic): Temporary overclock and reduced defect rate.
- Gift Drone Network (Logistics + Toy Innovation): Automated delivery prioritization.

Progression Curve:
1. Manual Production
2. Early Automation
3. Industrial Growth
4. Magical Integration
5. Optimization & Prestige

------------------------------------------------------------
3. RESOURCE & PRODUCTION SYSTEM
------------------------------------------------------------
Core Loop: Extract → Process → Assemble → Package → Deliver. Resources are infinite; extraction efficiency scales with research and technology.

Resource Categories:
- Raw: Wood, Stone, Iron Ore, Coal, Crude Plastic.
- Refined: Metal Ingot, Plank, Plastic Sheet, Glass.
- Components: Gear, Wheel, Cloth, Circuit Board, Spring.
- Toy Parts: Doll Head, Train Chassis, RC Frame, Plush Body.
- Magical: Aurora Essence, Stardust, Christmas Spirit.
- Energy: Electricity, Magic Power (aurora conduits).

Factory Systems:
- Transport: conveyors, pipes, carts/rails, magic conveyors.
- Storage: crates → depots → warehouses; smart IO filters.
- Power: generators, turbines, aurora reactors; batteries.
- Quality & Grading: speed, material grade, energy efficiency, magic infusion → S/A/B/C grades.

Example Pipeline – Toy Train:
1. Iron Ore → Smelter → Iron Ingot
2. Wood → Sawmill → Plank
3. Ingot + Plank → Press → Chassis & Wheels
4. Chassis + Wheels + Paint → Assembler → Toy Train
5. Toy Train → Wrapping Station → Wrapped Gift → Dispatch

------------------------------------------------------------
4. NARRATIVE & WORLDBUILDING
------------------------------------------------------------
Premise: Elves push for modernization to meet global demand. Santa leads a respectful fusion of tradition and technology. Tone is warm, humorous, and encouraging.

Setting & Regions:
- Central Workshop – cozy timber core with glowing windows.
- Industrial Outskirts – smokestacks, rails, cranes; still festive.
- Research Hills – cabins with telescopes and labs.
- Aurora Fields – open plains with dancing lights; magic harvest sites.

Cast:
- Santa – benevolent leader; sets quotas and celebrates wins.
- Tinka (Chief Engineer) – enthusiastic tutorial guide.
- Bramble (Union Leader) – comic foil, tradition advocate.
- Eira (Spirit Keeper) – steward of magic and balance.
- Rudolph AI – mission/logistics assistant with witty quips.

Story Acts:
1. The First Conveyor
2. Powering the North Pole
3. Magic Integration
4. The Great Christmas Rush
5. A New Year’s Workshop

------------------------------------------------------------
5. TECHNICAL DESIGN
------------------------------------------------------------
Engine: Unity 2022+ LTS (URP). PC‑first.

Architecture Layers:
