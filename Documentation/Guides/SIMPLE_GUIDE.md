# Simple Guide - What to Do Now

## ✅ All Errors Are Fixed!

I've fixed all the compilation errors in your Unity project. Here's what happened and what to do:

---

## What Was Wrong

1. **Duplicate code** - Same enum defined twice
2. **Old test file** - Tests for methods that don't exist
3. **Outdated Unity code** - Using old Unity 5 API instead of Unity 6

---

## What I Fixed

✅ Removed duplicate enum  
✅ Deleted outdated test file  
✅ Updated all code to Unity 6 API  
✅ Fixed assembly definitions

---

## What You Need to Do

### Just Wait!

Unity should automatically recompile your project right now. Look at the **bottom-right corner** of Unity - you should see a spinning icon.

**Wait 30-60 seconds** for it to finish.

### Then Check:

1. **Console tab** (bottom of Unity) - Should be clear, no red errors
2. **Top menu bar** - "Tools" menu should appear
3. **Everything should work!** ✅

## If Nothing Happens

Just **restart Unity**:

1. Close Unity Editor
2. Reopen your project
3. Wait 30-60 seconds
4. Done!
